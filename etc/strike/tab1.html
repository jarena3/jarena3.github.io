  Hey, I couldn't think of a better way to generate character sheets for this new system.
  This page will step you through building a character, and hopefully
  give you everything you need to write down. Unless I fucked something up because I'm
  writing all
  of this in an endless series of meetings.

<p>
  Characters in this game are made of two parts:
</p>
<p>
  The first is <b>Role</b>, or the position you play in team combat. A sports analogy
  would be eg. linebacker or quarterback.
  What you do in relation to your teammates, and what your teammates look to you for.
</p>
<p>
  The second is <b>Class</b>, which contains the mechanics behind your character's
  combat..
</p>
<p>
  The central element of character creation is <b>reskinning</b>. This game gives you a
  bunch of options that probably don't really
  fit your character, but encourages you to change the narrative mechanisms of the option
  to fit your concept.
