<h1 class="display-4">Introduction</h1>
<p>
  Hey, I couldn't think of a better way to generate character sheets for this new system (it costs money and I only have a
  digital copy, so printing 60+ pp. would be pretty rough). This page will step you through building a character, and hopefully
  give you everything you need to write down on that sheet I gave you. Unless I fucked something up because I'm writing all
  of this in an endless series of meetings.

  This game (called <a href="http://www.strikerpg.com">Strike!</a>) is a streamlined D&D 4th edition, and a lot of Dungeon
  World groups have been using it as basically a combat module. If you've played FF Tactics or X-COM or similar, it's basically
  that. If you've played Civilization, it's like unit combat if it was way more interesting.
</p>

  Characters in this game are made of two parts:
</p>
<p>
  The first is <b>Role</b>, or the position you play in team combat. A sports analogy would be eg. linebacker or quarterback.
  What you do in relation to your teammates, and what your teammates look to you for.
</p>
<p>
  The second is <b>Class</b>, which contains the mechanics behind your character's combat. This maps to the Dungeon World
  style class system. Gentlekiss calls upon the providence of his god, while Grimdolyn pulls from an elemental source of
  power &mdash; but both deal damage.
</p>
<p>
  The central element of character creation is <b>reskinning</b>. This game gives you a bunch of options that probably don't really
  fit your character, but encourages you to change the narrative mechanisms of the option to fit your concept. Eg. Gentlekiss
  would be a good fit for the Necromancer class, but obviously Bowie isn't a dark god of unlimited evil. A reskinned Necromancer
  class would be Gentlekiss <i>converting</i> enemies sufficiently beaten up to submit to the will of Bowie &mdash; as opposed
  to him reviving the corpses of fallen enemies. You don't have to worry about this now necessarily, we can discuss it in-game.
  The takeaway is that you should pick classes/roles/feats you think are fun, and we can worry about the details later.
