    Independent Projects
Portfolio Website:
This website, written from scratch, demonstrates my ability to work in HTTP, CSS, and Javascript, as well as jQuery and Bootstrap.

Jot Repository:
A collection of scripts in C#, JavaScript, Java, C++ and SQL. These code samples include code puzzles (Euler Project problems, XXX, XXX, etc), experiments, ideas, and naive implementations. The repository is intended to track my development as a programmer.

Diabolic:
An open-source Unity Engine project

World Generator:
An ongoing attempt at a robust procedural fantasy world generator, in the vein of Dwarf Fortress. Written in C#.

JLS Scheduling Utility:
An independent project I designed and completed while employed at JLS INC. Intended to reduce the beginning-of-semester workload for myself and the other teachers.
It parses .XLS files to build student lists, deserializes JSON to collect student book information, and then constructs .RTF, .DOCX, and .PDF files for use in the classroom and for distribution to teachers and administration. It is designed to be flexible and extensible, so that future teachers can continue to use it as a resource.
The program’s source, binaries, and documentation can be found here: XXXX

Evil Wizard Studios:
A website intended to host the small game and film projects created by myself and a small collection of my friends. I created the website, and all of the site’s art. The Evil Wizard Blog, which contains WIP posts and my general gamedev and programming thoughts can be found here:

Imgruber:
A cropped screenshot grabber that uploads to imgur.com and copies the resultant link directly to the clipboard. My attempt to get my printscreen-to-imgur pipeline as short as possible. Intended for the gamedev community, but free to use for anyone:
The source and documentation can be found here: XXXX
The most recent executable can be found here:

Blastronauts:
A competitive multiplayer game, written in C# under the Unity3D framework. The demo is available here: XXXXXXXXXX and access to the source code is available upon request.
